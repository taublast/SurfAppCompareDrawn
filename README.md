# Surfing App Drawn Comparison

Comparison between [.NET MAUI CollectionView](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/user-interface/controls/collectionview) and [DrawnUI](https://github.com/taublast/AppoMobi.Maui.DrawnUi.Demo) alternative.

Added drawn Xaml views to an existing MAUI app: https://github.com/jsuarezruiz/netmaui-surfing-app-challenge.

Both CollectionView and DrawnUI cells are recycled. MAUI CollectionView does not use shadows, whereas DrawnUI does.
